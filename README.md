 Scientific Calculator Web Application Documentation
 Introduction
This document provides a comprehensive overview of the HTML code that constructs a scientific calculator web application. The calculator offers a range of mathematical functions, operations, and constants to allow users to perform various calculations.

HTML Structure
The code defines an HTML document using the standard HTML5 structure. It consists of the following key components:

1. `<head>` Section:
   - The `<head>` section contains metadata and essential information for the web page.
   - The character encoding is set to UTF-8 to support a wide range of characters.
   - The `X-UA-Compatible` meta tag ensures compatibility with Internet Explorer.
   - The `viewport` meta tag adjusts the viewport to the device's width.
   - The external CSS stylesheet "style.css" is linked to provide styling for the calculator interface.
   - The `<title>` tag sets the title of the web page to "Scientific Calculator".

2. `<body>` Section:
   - The `<body>` section contains the visible content of the web page.
   - The calculator interface is encapsulated within a `<div>` element with the class "container".

Calculator Interface
The calculator interface is designed using HTML and CSS to create a user-friendly and visually appealing experience. The key elements of the interface include:

1. Calculator Container:
   - A `<div>` element with the classes "calculator" and "dark" contains the entire calculator interface.
   - The "dark" class is used for dark theme styling.

2. Theme Toggler:
   - A theme toggler is present at the top of the calculator.
   - It is represented by a `<div>` element with the classes "theme-toggler" and "active".
   - The theme toggler likely enables users to switch between different color themes.
   - An icon is displayed within the toggler using the `<i>` element with the class "toggler-icon".

3. Display Screen:
   - The main display screen is enclosed within a `<div>` element with the class "display-screen".
   - The content displayed on the screen is managed by an element with the ID "display".
   - This area is intended to show user input and calculation results.

4. Button Layout:
   - The calculator buttons are organized using a table structure for layout consistency.
   - Each row of buttons corresponds to a row in the table.
   - The buttons have various classes, such as "btn-operator" for operator buttons and "btn-number" for numeric buttons.

5. Functionality Buttons:
   - The calculator offers buttons for various mathematical functions, including logarithm, sine, cosine, tangent, exponentiation, factorial, square root, and more.
   - Additionally, buttons for common operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and percentage are included.

6. Numeric Buttons:
   - Numeric digits from 0 to 9 are represented as buttons with corresponding IDs.
   - A button for the decimal point is also provided for entering decimal numbers.

7. Special Buttons:
   - Special constants and symbols, such as the mathematical constant Ï€ (pi), are included as buttons.
 Script Integration
The calculator's functionality is intended to be implemented through an external JavaScript file named "script.js". The `<script>` tag at the end of the HTML document links to this external script. It is assumed that the script will handle user interactions, calculations, and updating the display on the calculator.

Conclusion
In summary, the provided HTML code constructs a scientific calculator web application with an intuitive user interface. Users can perform various calculations by interacting with buttons representing mathematical functions, operations, and constants. The calculator's appearance and potentially its behavior can be customized using the theme toggler. The calculator's functionality is expected to be implemented in the "script.js" file, which is referenced at the end of the HTML document.
